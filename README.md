### About this App
This was our first full stack app that we created at Prime during the first 6 weeks.
We used a PostgreSQL database with jQuery on the front end and Node.js/Express running our server.
It's a simple task list, it doesn't have users so all tasks are shared publicly.

### How it works

To run you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine.
Once installed, from the command line or terminal, enter ```npm install``` to install all the project dependencies.
To run you just need to enter ```npm start``` on the command line and go to [localhost:7000](http://localhost:7000/) 
to view the app.
